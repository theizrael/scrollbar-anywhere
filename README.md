# Scrollbar Anywhere

An extension for Google Chrome that makes it possible to to scroll pages as if the scrollbar was right under your pointer. i am in the process of make it functional for Atom as a package in the future, any help is welcome.

If you want grab-and-drag style scrolling, just set it up in the options.

The extension is based on the [Wet Banana extension](https://github.com/jedediah/wetbanana) and inspired by Scrollbar Anywhere for Firefox.
